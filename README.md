# 🧠 Project MindOS - The Operating System for a Synthetic Brain

> “An operating system that thinks.”

---

## 🌌 Overview

MindOS is a **synthetic cognitive framework**, a system that runs modules like *Perception*, *Memory*, *Emotion*, *Reasoning*, and *Action* as concurrent threads on a shared **Neural Bus**.  
Each process continuously communicates through predictive feedback and error correction, mirroring how the human brain maintains awareness and decision-making.

This project isn’t trained on data.  
It’s built on **architecture and theory** :- inspired by *predictive coding* and *Bayesian brain models*.  
The system literally “thinks” by design.

## 🧠 Architecture

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `core/kernel.py` | Boots, manages, and synchronizes all modules (the cognitive scheduler). |
| `bus/` | Neural Bus – message-passing layer between modules. |
| `modules/` | Cognitive subsystems: `perception.py`, `memory.py`, `reasoning.py`, `emotion.py`, `action.py`. |
| `dashboard/` | Real-time visualization of system activity and cognitive state. |
| `config/mindos_config.json` | Kernel and module parameters. |
| `run_mindos.py` | Launches the entire synthetic brain. |

## 🧩 Example Execution

────────────────────────────────────────── MindOS Booting ──────────────────────────────────────────
Perception sensing environment...
Emotion feels focused
Action executes: store memory
All modules initialized.

🧠 Synthetic cognition running...

Memory encoding memory → Perceived: external stimulus
Reasoning thinking → Inferred meaning of 'Perceived: external stimulus'
Emotion feels curious
Action executes: analyze
Emotion feels calm
Action executes: react

────────────────────────────────────────── MindOS Shutdown ──────────────────────────────────────────
All modules stopped. MindOS offline.

## 🧠 Scientific Foundations

MindOS draws on modern cognitive neuroscience:

- **Predictive Coding:** Each module predicts future inputs, communicating via feedback and error signals.  
- **Distributed Cognition:** Threads act like cortical regions; asynchronous yet cooperative.  
- **Emergent Behavior:** No external data :- the cognition arises from internal architecture.

Together, these principles model how a mind could emerge from the structure of computation itself.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The **Perception** module sends sensory data to the bus.  
2. **Memory** encodes it and passes it forward.  
3. **Reasoning** interprets it and forms inference chains.  
4. **Emotion** modulates cognitive urgency (tense, curious, calm…).  
5. **Action** selects a behavioral response.  
6. **Kernel** monitors heartbeats, keeps modules synchronized, and logs activity.  

The result? A synthetic OS where thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all active, concurrent threads.
